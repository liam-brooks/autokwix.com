Kick off your project with this blog boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

##  Start developing

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

## Why

Love to the car is similar to love to pets: dogs and cats. It isn't only rational, but also part of our lifestyle. We wash the our trucks, polish them, so they are beautiful, we feed them with the best oils and gasoline, we treat them if they get sick.

But the love of the car is not self-interested. We need him to realize our desires and ambitions.
We buy a brutal all-terrain vehicle or a pickup truck to seem physically stronger, more athletic, to feel our power over the world. In a sports car, we raise the level of adrenaline, relying on speed and power. In an expensive and beautiful luxury car, we feel like in a beautiful, solid suit, which not only serves as an element of clothing, but also creates an image.

The car - the most beloved and popular invention of mankind in recent years. If in the pre-automobile era, fashion was talked about only in relation to clothing, shoes, and perfumery, now automotive fashion occupies our minds to no less degree. A whole industry has appeared - tuning companies that create a seemingly completely meaningless product - decorate and stylize our cars, or customize them to the tastes and ambitions of a certain, narrow circle of consumers.

In general, the car became for us, as it were, an extension of ourselves. We can rush at a speed of 100 km per hour, almost without any effort. We can move from one place to another in a short time (forget about traffic jams for now). We can feel strong and swift. Even dogs like speed: they happily stick their faces out of the window of a racing car. A person is fascinated by speed, intoxicating. And the risk associated with fast driving often only enhances the stupefying effect of speed.

It’s not so important how we drive the car: we manually shift gears and squeeze the clutch, or the automatic does it for us, we move the ignition timing lever, like on a Ford-T, or we trust this with centrifugal and vacuum regulators, like on Tacome or Jeep JK, or electronics, as in modern cars. The main thing is that we ourselves control the speed, direction, we feel the freedom of movement. We can roll lazily and smoothly, but we can rush with smoke from under the wheels and with a squeal in the corners.

That is why I have created autokwix.com — to share my passion about cars.
